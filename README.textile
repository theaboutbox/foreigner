h1. Sparkfly Foreigner

sparkfly-foreigner is a fork of "Matt Higgins Foreigner":http://github.com/matthuhiggins/foreigner/ and the "dwilkie-foreigner":http://github.com/dwilkie/foreigner

Sparkfly requires an enterprise-ready Rails environment, which means we need solid PostgreSQL support and referential integrity.
Further, all of our plugins must be thoroughly tested. To make sure that PostgreSQL support is where we want it to be, the work
done by Matt Higgins and D. Wilkie were forked and all the tests were converted to use rspec. Dependency on plugin_test_helper
was taken out. 

h2. Test Coverage

These tests were created and tested against our target platform, Rails 3. If you are using Rails 2.3.5, 
use sparkfly-foreigner 0.6.0. this currently works with Rails 3.0 beta 3.

Rspec coverage was against Rspec 2.0 beta6

PostgreSQL (tested against 8.3.9, 8.4.2)
 - "Schema" tests: do the table migrations actually add referential integrity?
 - "Schema Extractor" tests: does the foreign_key() method extract out the foreign key from information_schema? 
 - "Semantics" tests: do the add/drop constraints emit proper SQL?

MySQL (tested against 5.0.90 / Gentoo mysql-5.0.90-r2 hardened x86_64)
 - "Schema" tests: do the table migrations actually add referential integrity?
 - "Schema Extractor" tests: does the foreign_key() method extract out the foreign key from information_schema? 
 - "Semantics" tests: do the add/drop constraints emit proper SQL?

SQLite3 (tested against 3.6.22 in-memory only)
 - "Semantics" tests: do the add/drop constraints emit proper SQL?
 - Warning: sqlite3 probably does not actually work when you use it.

Schema Dumper
 - Are we emitting the correct schema.rb syntax for adding foreign key constraints?

TODO:
 - CHECK Constraints (PostgreSQL-only)
 - CHECK Constraints implemented as triggers for MySQL. This is unlikely to be supported since we don't plan to deploy to MySQL

h2. Usage 

h3. Installation

Add this to your Gemfile:
<pre>
  gem 'sparkfly-foreigner', :require => 'foreigner'
</pre>

h3. Migrations

To specify a different column name you can do the following:
<pre>
  create_table :comments do |t|
    t.integer :article_id, :null => false
    t.foreign_key :post, :column => :article_id
  end
</pre>

To specify dependencies (nullify or delete) you can do the following:
<pre>
  create_table :comments do |t|
    t.references :post, :foreign_key => {:dependent => :delete}, :null => false
  end
</pre>

Here's another example using a different column name and the dependent option
<pre>
  create_table :comments do |t|
    t.integer :article_id, :null => false
    t.foreign_key :post, :column => :article_id, :dependent => :nullify
  end
</pre>

To specify a reference with a foreign key constraint using Rails convention:
<pre>
  create_table :comments do |t|
    t.references :post, :foreign_key => true, :null => false
  end
</pre>

Read the specs for more example usage.

h3. schema.rb

All of the constrants are updated in schema.rb when you either:
<pre>
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:schema:dump
</pre>
This allows you to see the state of your migratons and
take advantage of using <pre>rake db:schema:load</pre>

h2. Testing

You will need rspec 2.0. At the time of this writing, you install it with:
<pre>
gem install rspec --pre
</pre>

You will also want to make sure you have Rubygems 1.3.6

Run "rake spec" to run all the spec. Make sure that all of the PostgreSQL and MySQL databases defined in 
spec/spec_helper.rb are created before you run those tests.
